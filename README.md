# The Game of Black Jack


## Synopsis

The game of Black Jack is one of luck and risk. 

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Black Jack is a fun game. I chose to try my hand at building this game from scratch because I enjoy playing it myself and wanted a challenge that appealed to me.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
